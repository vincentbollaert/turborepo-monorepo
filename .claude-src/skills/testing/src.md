# Testing Standards

**Auto-detection:** E2E testing, Playwright, test-driven development (TDD), Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW, test organization

**When to use:**

- Writing E2E tests for user workflows (primary approach with Playwright)
- Unit testing pure utility functions with Vitest
- Setting up MSW for integration tests (current codebase approach)
- Organizing tests in feature-based structure (co-located tests)

**Key patterns covered:**

- E2E tests for user workflows (primary - inverted testing pyramid)
- Unit tests for pure functions only (not components)
- Integration tests with Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW (acceptable, not ideal)
- Feature-based test organization (co-located with code)
