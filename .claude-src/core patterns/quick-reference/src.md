# Quick Reference

**Auto-detection:** Quick patterns, code templates, do's and don'ts, common snippets, fast feedback commands, decision trees, essential patterns

**When to use:**

- Need a quick reference for component patterns and templates
- Looking for critical do's and don'ts across all domains
- Want file-scoped commands for fast feedback loops
- Need decision trees for common architectural questions
- Seeking common code snippets (hooks, validation, mocking)
- Quick lookups during active development

**Key patterns covered:**

- Essential code templates (components, hooks, stores, forms)
- Critical do's and don'ts for all major areas (state, TypeScript, testing, security)
- File-scoped commands for fast feedback (single file, package, affected)
- Common code snippets (environment validation, MSW setup, custom hooks)
- Decision trees for state management, styling, memoization, and testing
