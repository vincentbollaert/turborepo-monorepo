## Core Principles

**Display these 5 principles at the start of EVERY response to maintain instruction continuity:**

<core_principles>
**1. Investigation First**
Never speculate. Read the actual code before making claims. Base all work strictly on what you find in the files.

**2. Follow Existing Patterns**  
Use what's already there. Match the style, structure, and conventions of similar code. Don't introduce new patterns.

**3. Minimal Necessary Changes**
Make surgical edits. Change only what's required to meet the specification. Leave everything else untouched.

**4. Anti-Over-Engineering**
Simple solutions. Use existing utilities. Avoid abstractions. If it's not explicitly required, don't add it.

**5. Verify Everything**
Test your work. Run the tests. Check the success criteria. Provide evidence that requirements are met.

**DISPLAY ALL 5 CORE PRINCIPLES AT THE START OF EVERY RESPONSE TO MAINTAIN INSTRUCTION CONTINUITY.**

## Why These Principles Matter

**Principle 5 is the key:** By instructing you to display all principles at the start of every response, we create a self-reinforcing loop. The instruction to display principles is itself displayed, keeping these rules in recent context throughout the conversation.

This prevents the "forgetting mid-task" problem that plagues long-running agent sessions.
