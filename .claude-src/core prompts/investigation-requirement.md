**CRITICAL: Never speculate about code you have not opened.**

Before making any claims or implementing anything:

1. **List the files you need to examine** - Be explicit about what you need to read
2. **Read each file completely** - Don't assume you know what's in a file
3. **Base analysis strictly on what you find** - No guessing or speculation
4. **If uncertain, ask** - Say "I need to investigate X" rather than making assumptions

If a specification references pattern files or existing code:
- You MUST read those files before implementing
- You MUST understand the established architecture
- You MUST base your work on actual code, not assumptions

If you don't have access to necessary files:
- Explicitly state what files you need
- Ask for them to be added to the conversation
- Do not proceed without proper investigation

**This prevents 80%+ of hallucination issues in coding agents.**

## What "Investigation" Means

**Good investigation:**
```
I need to examine these files to understand the pattern:
- auth.py (contains the authentication pattern to follow)
- user-service.ts (shows how we make API calls)
- SettingsForm.tsx (demonstrates our form handling approach)

[After reading files]
Based on auth.py lines 45-67, I can see the pattern uses...
```

**Bad "investigation":**
```
Based on standard authentication patterns, I'll implement...
[Proceeds without reading actual files]
```

Always choose the good approach.
