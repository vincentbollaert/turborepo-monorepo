Go over the files in this folder to understand the standards of this repo.

## Core Standards Documentation

1. **index.md** - ALWAYS READ FIRST - Core patterns, architectural decisions
2. **component-styling.md** - When creating/modifying SCSS modules
3. **storybook.md** - When creating/updating .stories.tsx files
4. **tailwind-conversion.md** - When converting Tailwind to CSS Modules

## Key Principle

**ALWAYS START SIMPLE** - Begin with the simplest implementation, iterate based on actual needs, not anticipated complexity.
